# Audit your IoT Fleet
TODO: need to write a use case here
- need to detect if devices sharing cert --> authentication + authorization
- need to give appropriate permission following least priviledge model
- need to know if IoT logging is disable (AWS IoT logs in CloudWatch provide visibility into behaviors in AWS IoT, including authentication failures and unexpected connects and disconnects that might indicate that a device has been compromised. )

## 1. Enable Audit

## 2. Take actions to mitigate issues found during Audit
