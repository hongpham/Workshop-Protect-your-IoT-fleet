# Protecting your IoT Fleet

You are the Security Engineer for a manufacturing company with fabrication facilities all of North America. The quality assurance teams have requested deploying IoT sensors throughout the facilities to measure things such as temperature of equipment, weight and speed of conveyor systems, and scanner viewing products on the assembly line. You are tasked with securing the IoT devices from deployment through decommissioning. The QA team has provided simulated IoT devices for you to use in building those security controls. Now let's start implementing solutions to protect these IoT devices.
