# Protecting your IoT Fleet

You are a Security Engineer for a retail company that has fulfillment centers all across North America. Each fulfillment centers have thousands of IoT (Internet of Thing) devices measure things such as temperature of equipment, weight and speed of conveyor systems, and scanner viewing products on the assembly line. The Software Engineer teams decided to send telementry data generated by IoT devices to the cloud for scalability. As a Security Engineer, you are tasked with securing the IoT devices from deployment through decommissioning. The QA team has provided simulated IoT devices for you to use in building those security controls

To achieve these requirement, you need to:

   1. Make sure devices security configuration is correct
   2. Use automation to detect devices compromised from bad actors
   3. Implement real-time notification solutions to react quickly to compromised devices. 
   

## Terminology
Before diving into 

## Agenda
### 1. [Module 1: Environment build](/Module%201:%20Environment%20build)
This module walks you through environment setup. This includes provisioning a CloudFormation stack (if you run this lab by yourself), validate IoT devices configuration, and check if telemetry data is sent to AWS IoT.

### 2. [Module 2: Audit your IoT Fleet](/Module%202:%20Audit%20your%20IoT%20Fleet)
In Moduel 2, you create an AWS IoT Audit to check for miss-configuration for all of you devices. You will learn how to start an audit, and apply Mitigation Actions to remediate problem with devices have bad configurations

### 3. [Module 3: Detect and response to a compromised device](/Module%203:%20Detect%20and%20response%20to%20a%20compromised%20device)
Module 3 shows you how to detect if devices are compromised and participates in bad actions. You will simulate a scenerios when devices are sending significantly larger message size than it's expected message size. You then will build a Quarantive Thing Group, and move bad devices into this Thing Group to take away devices' permission to send data to AWS IoT. 

### 4. [Module 4: Receive alerts in real-time](/Module%204:%20Receive%20alerts%20in%20real-time)
This extra-credit module shows you how to receive a real-time notification when your devices misbehave. You can choose to work with multiple communication tools: Amazon Chime, Slack, or SMS
